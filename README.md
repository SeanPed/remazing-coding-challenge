CSS Styling descision:
why i dont used bootstraß or Tailwind and no styled components as well:
As you can see in the code, we are using CSS modules. CSS modules provide a lot of flexibility as they are great for scoping CSS and passing styles around.

Icons:
used Heroicons for icons because i decided so - was esier to use and more scalable as for example react-icons

navigation sidebar: warum entschiedn so und so?

to do for me - Wendesday and Thursday!

SideBar - const -> wieso nicht in einer extra componente? Lösung finden.

anlesen - temperate liberal? `$ usw.

where does margin-top: -16px; in sidebar Area comes from ffs?
