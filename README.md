Hello!

This is my repository for the remazing front-end coding challenge.
You can start the application via "npm start" this will trigger the vite server to start and display the application in the "localhost:(port of your choice)".
In the following, I would like to go into some things that are important for understanding and reading my project.


CSS Decision - Styled Components:
For me, in a React project, the "each style is a component" approach was of great importance. I find that working component based and at the same time converting each element with styled components into another component creates an enormous de-cluttering of the code. 
In my eyes this avoids cluttering up the folder structure and makes everything more understandable and readable for someone that wasn't initially involved in the project and is just lookint at it for the first time.

Folder structure:
Components: Here you can find all Components that I build.

Public: Here you can find all the assets that I used for the project (images, fonts and screenshots).

Views:
Here you can find all the Content for the Views Area inside the application.



If you have questions feel free to contact me!

Happy Hacking! :)
